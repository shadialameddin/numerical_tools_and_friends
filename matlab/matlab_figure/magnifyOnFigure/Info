This utility provides a powerful zooming tool specially designed for the documentation of original and zoomed 2D graphics of images on the same plot.

It is composed of two blocks (the secondary axes and the magnifier). The secondary axes, which can be arbitrarily allocated within the limits of the figure, displays the area marked by the magnifier.

The highly versatile interface of the 'on-figure magnifier' offers a world of possibilities in a broad range of applications and fields. The Keyboard/mouse or programmatic configuration of this tool allows the user to set her or his own graphic style, to suit the requirements of any publication's editor. More details on interfacing and properties can be found in the .m file.

EXAMPLE: (for usage examples, run 'magnifyOnFigure_examples.m')

PROPERTIES:
'secondaryAxesFaceColor': ColorSpec
'edgeWidth' Color of the box surrounding the secondary
axes, magnifier and link. Default 1
'edgeColor': Color of the box surrounding the secondary
axes, magnifier and link. Default 'black'
'displayLinkStyle': Style of the link. 'none', 'straight' or
'edges', with 'straight' as default.
'mode': 'manual' or 'interactive' (allowing
adjustments through mouse/keyboard). Default
'interactive'.
'units' Units in which the position vectors are
given. Only 'pixels' currently supported
'initialPositionSecondaryAxes': Initial position vector ([left bottom width height])
of secondary axes, in pixels
'initialPositionMagnifier': Initial position vector ([left bottom width height])
of magnifier, in pixels
'secondaryAxesXLim': Initial XLim value of the secondary axes
'secondaryAxesYLim': Initial YLim value of the secondary axes
